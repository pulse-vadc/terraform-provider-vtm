## Introduction

`terraform-provider-vtm` is a Terraform "provider" to facilitate the configuration of Pulse 
vTM from within Terraform templates.  It supports a comprehensive range of
"resources" and "data sources" to allow almost any vTM configuration to be expressed 
in Terraform format.

To build the terraform provider simply run build.sh for one of the supported API
versions.

You will need to have golang 1.17.6 or higher and have GOROOT set
appropriately.
